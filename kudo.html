                        <p>This Series A-funded, Manhattan-based startup was 
                            founded by Fardad Zabetian, a tech expert in the live 
                            interpretation space, and a small group of highly-skilled 
                            interpretation thought leaders. The company initially 
                            managed hardware and software for physical booths in multi-language locations and events.

                        <p>KUDO was venturing into the digital space with 
                            some of their products, and were adopting a more 
                            product team mindset. They had received an enormous
                            spike in customers and usage due to the onset of 
                            Covid—and their applications and 
                            implementation team were stretched way beyond their limits.
                        </p>

                            build out and educate the company towards a product model. 
                            She aimed to introduce usability testing and iterative design,
                            and in-parallel create a product team of owners and 
                            managers delivering Agile methodology to the tech team.

                                        leaders' minds into something valuable and necessary</li>

                                        owned that space. Also products were spun up
                                        and cancelled too quickly to make that exercise valuable.</i></li>

                            They are not "translating" word-for-word, as I 
                            had thought—but they are "interpreting" 
                            like poets to bring meaning and color to

                            than interpretation had a love for language, 
                            as well as a passion for precision and expressiveness 
                            in their word choices. As a UX professional

                            and aims for mutually satisfying conversations,

                            One French woman, who interpreted between English and French, 
                            met someone from Portugal in her twenties. She couldn't 
                            believe the beauty of the Portuguese language 
                            and was transfixed by how the words were formed. 
                            She said to me, 'I told him to keep speaking, 
                            and I don't care what you say—I just want to 
                            see how you form the words!' She was so determined 
                            to immerse herself in the language that she moved 
                            to Argentina and never looked back.                
                        </p>

                            for the United Nations, who interpreted for six presidents, 
                            numerous EU leaders, and had a native command of 
                            English and Portuguese. He was fluent in Spanish, 
                            French, Italian, and German. He shared a quote with 
                            me that has stuck with me: <br><br>

                                    product feedback, but remained guarded and hesitant.
                                    They were skeptical about UX in general—and were
                                    envisioning resources being tied up and more spending dev

                                    two camps, and would have like to explore differing views given
                                    more time and budget.

                                        They always need to study up on the subject matter

                                <p>I was able to make a positive impact on
                                    the interpretation-side stakeholders as
                                    well as with their lead innovator. They 
                                    were glad to know a UX framework existed 
                                    to help them create a better product,
                                    reduce errors and potentially shorten
                                    the client onboarding (4 hour sessions). 
                                </p>
                        
                                 <p>The product director and founder
                                     were very skeptical of adding more
                                     people and initiatives to products.
                                     And I was told directly "UX research
                                     is nothing but a waste of time" and
                                     in other direct ways.
                                </p>
                                
                                <p>The VP of Product had taken that
                                    battle under her wing, and was approaching
                                    the C-Suite with her own direction—
                                    so she'd asked me to stand down in 
                                    many occassions. I hadn't learned about
                                    what came of her efforts, but saw she'd no 
                                    longer worked with the company shortly after 
                                    my time had ended.
                                </p>
                        

                                <p>On a personal note, I learned about
                                    localization, some nuances and importance
                                    with dealing with different languages 
                                    and cultures. I'm still pursuing learning
                                    more about that space.
                                </p>
                        
                                <p>I also learned there are ratings or levels of 
                                    fluency called the CEFR framework. And 
                                    that motivated me to pursue learning 
                                    languages as a hobby.
